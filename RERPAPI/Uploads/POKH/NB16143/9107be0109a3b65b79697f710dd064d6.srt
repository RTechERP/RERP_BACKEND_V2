00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,410
Instructor: When we have items in our shopping cart

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,170
and when a user clicks on the summary page,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,420
what is it that we want?

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,818
We want to display a page where

5
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:13,950
on the right side we will see all the products.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,340
And on the left side we will capture the information

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,500
for shipping details.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,160
Like we will need name, phone numbers, street address,

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,950
and once we get all the address details

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,743
then we will have a pattern to place order.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,040
So rather than designing that page,

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,250
I have provided that design in the (indistinct).

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,170
If you go to section 10, that will be a summary U I.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,820
Copy everything there

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,940
and we need to create an action method for that.

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,563
And then create a view.

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,840
In the card controller here right after index,

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,270
let me create an action method

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,000
which will have I action result.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,130
Call that as summary.

21
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,770
And for now, let me just return

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,570
back to the view, right click here, add a view.

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,280
We will give it the exact same name, which is summary.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,870
Let's add that.

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,110
And I will paste all the H T M L that we copied

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,060
from the template.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,030
Now again, you can see here it is all H T M L

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,830
and C S S and nothing related to dot net core.

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,340
So there are no tag helpers or any eraser code

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,460
purely H T M L, and C S S .

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,630
And we will go to index here

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,670
where we have the summary link here.

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,663
We will go to E S P Action of summary.

34
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,270
Let me run the project

35
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,693
and take a look at the UI that we pasted.

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,688
Let me go to shopping cart and here, rather than

37
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:57,688
displaying zero, let me open underscore layout for now

38
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,230
and I will remove that because we do not have zero items.

39
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,480
We actually have items in the cart.

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,650
That looks good.

41
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,169
If we navigate the shopping cart,

42
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,740
and if I go to summary here, great.

43
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,190
You can see we have to provide the shipping details here

44
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,570
all of the fields

45
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,143
and we have to populate the order summary as well.

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,396
When a user populates this information,

47
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,100
where will we hold that information?

48
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,880
When an order is actually placed in a typical website,

49
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,770
we have all of this information

50
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,400
in order header and then in order details.

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,840
We have all the product details inside that order

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,300
but we do not have a model for that.

53
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,460
So let me create that model first

54
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,633
for order header and order details in the next video.
